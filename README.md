Entity: Real-Time Generative Visuals
Entity transforms static digital assets into dynamic, ever-evolving visuals.
Unlike traditional pre-rendered animations, Entity generates visuals in real time through code-driven, interactive transformations.

How It Works
Entity begins as a static LSP8 asset (or LSP7 for this demo) stored in your Universal Profile.
However, not every asset can be used. To maintain visual fidelity and appeal, the asset must be specifically designed or prepared for Entity.

Owning a whitelisted asset unlocks the ability to:

✅ Customize your Entity’s look by adjusting parameters like animation speed, blend modes, and layer positioning.
✅ Save these configurations directly to your Universal Profile metadata, making your Entity unique to you.
✅ Share your personalized Entity—when others visit your profile, they see it exactly as you designed it.

Creating Assets for Entity
Entity is an open system, meaning anyone can create compatible assets, as long as they follow a basic ruleset:

✅ High Resolution – The asset must meet a minimum resolution (exact size TBA).
✅ Transparent Background – To allow layering and visibility of underlying layers.
✅ Isolated Subject – The asset must be fully contained within the canvas, without extending beyond its edges.

Assets that extend beyond the canvas create visible straight lines, negatively affecting the final visual.
Additionally, fully covered canvases or designs that lack whitespace are not allowed.

This built-in constraint prevents AI-generated copy-paste artworks and instead promotes collections with varying shapes, leading to more diverse and engaging compositions when mixed and matched.

What Makes Entity Unique?
✅ Real-Time Generation – No pre-rendered animations; everything is generated live.
✅ Customizable & Interactive – Adjust parameters on the fly, from layer effects to blend modes.
✅ Exclusive to Whitelisted Assets – Ensuring only high-quality visuals are used.
✅ Stored on Your Profile – Your visual configurations are saved in your Universal Profile, making them uniquely yours.
✅ Lossless Quality – Every visual is rendered at the highest fidelity.

With Entity, your NFTs are no longer just static images—they become living, evolving digital artworks that you control.




Beyond simply displaying art, Entity is interactive. Every layer can be adjusted in speed, scale, drift, and blend modes, offering unparalleled customization possibilities, directly stored within your Universal Profile’s metadata.
What truly sets Entity apart is its ability to function as both a visualization platform and a generative engine, allowing the creation and adjustment of hypnotizing, kaleidoscopic visuals in real time.

When paired with LSP1, the Universal Receiver, Entity redefines on-chain interaction and makes it visual, introducing a customizable, real-time notification layer on top of your Universal Profiles.
By breaking free from the constraints of static NFTs, rigid collections, and walled-garden ecosystems, Entity pioneers a fluid, decentralized, and interactive approach to digital ownership.

It’s an open-ended creative tool, designed to seamlessly merge art, interactivity, and utility, unlocking a new era of modular, cross-collection and functional creativity.

Being part of the LUKSO Luminaries, I would also like to take the time to use Entity as a tool to explain rather vague and complex concepts that surround Universal Profiles.
I say complex because alot of terms throughout the years, have been misused to a great extend. We have lost the touch to the true meaning of the word and that's where alot of confusion finds it's root.
This market is one that is largely driven by hype and a large part of the market is focused on the extraction of money. Centralized parties falsely make use of words and definition through buzzwords to extract money out of the users pocket.
A market led by ego, but also one that is chased by ego. Centralized parties, especially in crypto are closer to downfall than you may think. 
there’s been quite some misuse of certain buzzwords that generate hype rather than guiding people toward true innovation.

Im not going to point out that this is better than that, i will clarify a whole lot in another article if you want my view on the fragemented landscape.

True ownership, that its not about owning something but what you can do with it.
Decentralization, why important? And how centralization implies the creative boundary. 
Why decentralization is the only way forward if we want to move forward.
Collaboration and the philosophical aspects around universal profiles, centralization also making collaboration a thing that inherently limits this part just because of what centralization makes possible. you NEED them.
Collectors and co creators and entity, how to get involved. Think Outside the box
How decentralized apps and enhancements look like for an ecosystem painted by entity
Universal profiles is everything where ethereum is scattered. The vision is too scattered, it has no central vision anymore
LUKSO is a product of 7 years and universal profiles until today STILL flying under the radar is the single greatest marketing stunt you will ever experience.
Because it is so laser focused it did not experience any fragmentation, imagine twitter x 1000 with alot of activity, not fully being able to build out how they want it, 
everyone has its eyes on lukso because only decentralization bring innovation forward. Its a clean slate, we dont have to deal with LIMITATIONs. Everything you see beyond this point cannot be executed in the right way.
LUKSO is not lukso LUKSO is matter of fact EVERYTHING there is no need for another LUKSO thats why there is nothing and they are just standing at the sidelines trying to make their models work but they see they cant make it work
or they dont wanna try. They are not capturing a narrative they are stealing and extorting a narrative, only to get a quick gain and then DUMP and steal from another idea
while in the meantime we are building a TANK piece by piece. wanting a detailed roadmap from universal everything , wanting to see proof of what they do, sayhing they need to do this or that is exactly what we are steering away from.
You are not suggesting anything with this. You are only Explicitly stating you want a linear path, you want a leader to take responsibiility while you have to stop asking the questions and do your thing instead doing what you always did.
and that is looking at a central point WANTING them to take control when essentially its DECENTRALIZATION that we need. Universal profiles is the COMPASS you need need. And not the linear path you want it to follow.

Or at least, looks like people are shifting towards them. You see, there are two levels at play here that need to be revealed, and I need you to really get it through and through.

This way, you will not only understand the implications of Universal Profiles, but it will also completely and utterly shatter any doubts you might have about what this technology truly enables.

A large part of this has to do with philosophical aspects rather than purely technical concepts.

The technical part—we have heard enough of it by now. Instead, I want to make it approachable for non-technical people by giving you an artist’s point of view.

The bonus? I can immediately link it to Entity, a 100% visual app that eliminates any hesitation.
